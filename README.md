# Tour Planner

Welcome to the **Tour Planner**! This simple and responsive application, built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**, allows users to explore and manage a list of tours. Users can view tour details, remove tours they are not interested in, and refresh the list to restore all tours. The app features interactive tour cards with a "Read more" toggle for extended descriptions, making it a great example of modern web development with React and Tailwind CSS. Perfect for those learning React or in need of a tour management component for other projects.
